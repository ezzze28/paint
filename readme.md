# Overview
Painting App  
This is a simple drawing application written in Java using Swing. The application allows users to draw on a canvas, choose colors from a palette, erase using a background color, save their drawings as PNG images, and undo their actions. It demonstrates the use of basic Java features and the Java Swing library for creating graphical user interfaces.

The purpose of writing this software was to learn and apply fundamental Java programming concepts, including variables, loops, conditionals, classes, and data structures. Additionally, the project showcases the use of Java Swing for GUI development and recursion for implementing the flood-fill functionality.

# Future Work
- Add more advanced drawing tools, such as shapes (circles, rectangles, etc.).
- Implement a redo functionality to complement the undo feature.
- Allow users to load existing images into the canvas for editing.
- Optimize the flood-fill algorithm for performance on larger images.
- Add more customization options for brush styles and patterns.
